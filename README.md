## Project Overview

This project analyzes global causes of death from 1990 to 2019 using the ‘Causes of Death - Our World In Data’ dataset. The analysis covers data cleaning using Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for initial insights, and creating interactive visualizations in Tableau to present trends and patterns across countries and time periods.

### Key Features
Data Cleaning:
	•	Used Python for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, formatting, etc.).
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted initial data exploration with Python to uncover key insights:
	•	Distribution of causes of death globally: Analyzed the proportion of different causes of death to see which are most prevalent globally.
	•	Death trends over the years: Investigated how the total number of deaths from major causes has changed between 1990 and 2019.
	•	Top causes of death by country: Identified the leading causes of death for different countries.
	•	Year-over-year percentage change: Calculated the percentage change in deaths due to specific causes over the years.
	•	Interactive Tableau Dashboard:
	•	Filter by Cause of Death, Year (1990-2019), and Country to explore specific trends.
	•	Global heatmap showing death distribution across countries.
	•	Visual representation of the Top Causes of Death Globally.
	•	Historical trend analysis to reveal changes in mortality over time.

Technologies Used

	•	Python: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
	•	Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard design.

Dataset

	•	Source: Our World In Data - Causes of Death

EDA Highlights

	1.	Global Distribution of Causes of Death:
	•	Visualized the share of deaths by various causes such as cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and respiratory diseases using bar charts and pie charts.
	2.	Death Trends Over the Years:
	•	Generated line plots to analyze the trajectory of death rates for major causes between 1990 and 2019.
	3.	Top Causes of Death by Country:
	•	Created a country-wise breakdown of the most common causes of death with heatmaps and country-specific bar charts.
	4.	Year-over-Year Percentage Change:
	•	Calculated and visualized the percentage change in death numbers for key causes like cardiovascular diseases and lower respiratory infections over time.

Dashboard Highlights

	1.	Total Number of Deaths: Displays the overall global mortality count from 1990 to 2019.
	2.	Top Causes of Death Globally: A bar chart ranking the leading causes of death with detailed figures.
	3.	Deaths by Country: A global map showing the distribution of deaths across different countries.
	4.	Death Trends Over Time: Line graph visualizing the changes in mortality rates for different causes of death.
	5.	Death Numbers by Country and Year: A heatmap showing year-over-year mortality patterns by country.
